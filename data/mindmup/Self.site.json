I wrote the front-end in  ES6 JavaScript with Angularjs. I also used Sass, Webpack and Gulp as part of the build. Their E-commerce platform had to handle a large amount of data. The challenge in this project was figuring out a way to implement state change in Angular without affecting performance. I resorted to using Angular-Flux and was able to push state changes into the application to avoid the performance bottleneck of scope watches."

I finished my degree in information systems, then came to the US on a scholarship to finish my Master's. I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2014 with a Master's in Health Information Systems. I met my wife, Rebecca and we got Married in a farm in Butler, PA. We had an amazing wedding, surrounded by Alpacas, Turkey, Guinea hens. Here are some pictures from the wedding. My wife and I are from completely different backgrounds. She is Jewish and I grew up Muslim. I find comfort in getting to know cultures and I cherish the connections that I make with other people. In 2015, Rebecca and I started an international potluck group in Denver (where we lived) and we enjoyed delicous food and wonderful company. We had people from all continents and we added a few pounds to our weight."

                          "text": "I think functional programming is the absolute essence of applied math. It uses the patterns that math gives us (give examples here) and enable us to use them in our computational model. The model itself is very flexible to change and follows certain patterns. When I say patterns I mean sometimes math falls short and we need to apply engineering to our problems not unified absolute truths. Chaos isn't really well represented in math and so functional programming in my opinion needs to learn from that shortcoming. That's why it's inspired by Math and not all of Math. I am not saying it's a bad one. That's why in the past 4-5 years it has seen a lot of adoption in imperative programming languages. Frameworks like React has seen a lot of adoption in the Javascript Front-end programming world. I think because there are certain patterns that it (functional programming) provides, that makes it very easy for us to solve certain problems. For example, if we look at the concept of Immutability, it's just a glorified (something in math) and we use it because other people have figured out that pattern. This pattern follows a strict standard that the functional programming ideology enforces making it a prime candidate for a small chance of errors and bugs. I think functional programming is a way for developers to enjoy some self inflicting fetish kinda pain. Because working with functional programming makes me think of the times I loathed math and hated it in school, but at the same time I loved it. That's really my story of how I got into functional programming. I was an imperative and OOP programmer for a while. I started around two years ago. I was moving very slowly, but then got a really nice introduction to functional programming in Javascript using this wonderful series (FP in Javascript). Last year, I started going back to math, I just wanted to indulge myself in the abstract and math was just perfect for that. Going back and reading algebra made me think of how similar functional programming is to just Algebra. I always loved Algebra in school, that was the only thing I was hanging on to from my math days. Something about Algebra makes me think of a system designed by a mathematicians throughout history and that system got through a series of scrutiny and thought. That's why, although I think Functional programming isn't the solution to everything, I really believe it's a well designed system backed by systemic rigor and scrutiny for centuries, which is much better (in some cases) to the years of work we can put in into our short lived designs (no offense). Again, I am probably reiterating what other people have said before me about functional programming, but I am just seeing the connection. The patterns only apply if you have three main things: High order functions, immutability, and a \"plus\" is tail call optimization. High order functions are used as a building block for everything. Functions then have an input and an output or we can think of it in math as addition subtraction and multiplocation, but substitute operation with other things too (abstract algebra?). So an example would be function compose can take two functions and then the output would be whatever the second function returns. Take a look at this diagram:\ncompose(run, hide)(human) or var a = run(human) and var b = hide(human) ===>"
                        }
